# Black Money Classification

This project builds a classification model to identify suspicious or potentially illicit financial transactions, which may indicate black money activity.

## 🧠 Objective
To develop a predictive model that flags transactions based on patterns commonly associated with black money using supervised learning methods.

## 📊 Features
- Dataset exploration and hypothesis generation
- Feature transformation and encoding
- Classification model development (XGBoost, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Performance evaluation with precision/recall focus
- Sensitivity analysis for false positives

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the noteboook: jupyter notebook black-money-classification.ipynb

## 📌 Notes
While sensitive topics like black money require ethical considerations, this project remains strictly academic and focused on ML methods and anomaly detection techniques.
